# Hi, this is Boris

Senior Software Developer with an architectural and devops focus with 10+ years of experience. 
Worked on B2B, B2C, IPaaS and SaaS solutions. 

I am not a ticket-mover; I am a standard-setter. 

Building deterministic, explicit systems where others would rely on implicit "magic." Driven by a relentless focus on optimization and elegance, I reject "good enough" in favor of robust, future-proof architecture. 

I bring a senior-level depth that transforms development teams to powerhouses that can deliver applications and code as needed, where needed.

I am brutally focused on code quality, pushing for fully decoupled architectures and testable, beautiful code. I refuse to be a passive implementer; I actively redesign complex legacy systems into performant, scalable engines. 

Whether it’s introducing new paradigms or mentoring juniors in SOLID principles, my goal is to leave both the codebase and the team significantly smarter than I found them
